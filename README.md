# Bike Sales Data Analysis (Excel Project)

This is a self-driven data analysis project based on a bike sales dataset from Kaggle. I used Microsoft Excel to clean and analyze the data, create custom columns, answer business questions, and build an interactive dashboard using PivotTables and slicers.
